# AI Conversation Engine with GPT-4 Turbo

This document describes the enhanced OpenAI integration for creating highly contextual, emotionally intelligent conversations.

## Overview

The AI Conversation Engine uses GPT-4 Turbo to generate responses that are:
- **Memory-Enhanced**: Draws from persona's complete memory bank
- **Emotionally Intelligent**: Detects and responds to user emotions
- **Contextually Aware**: References shared history and experiences
- **Authentically Personal**: Maintains consistent personality and speaking style

## Key Features

### 1. Memory-Enhanced Conversations

Every conversation automatically:
- Searches vector database for relevant memories (up to 15 most relevant)
- Ranks memories by importance and relevance
- Integrates memories naturally into responses
- Extracts new memories from the conversation itself

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "I'm feeling stressed about work"
→ System searches memories for: work, stress, career, challenges
→ Finds memories: "User works in software development", "Gets anxious about deadlines"
→ AI responds with context: "I remember how seriously you take your work..."
```

### 2. Emotion Detection & Response

Real-time emotional intelligence:
- Analyzes user message for primary emotion and intensity
- Adapts response tone to match emotional context
- Validates feelings without minimizing them
- Offers appropriate support based on emotion type

**Supported Emotions:**
- Happy, Sad, Anxious, Angry
- Nostalgic, Loving, Grateful
- Confused, Excited, Lonely

### 3. Advanced Prompt Engineering

Three specialized prompt types:

#### Standard Enhanced Prompt
```
- Includes personality traits
- References relevant memories
- Maintains speaking style
- Shows emotional intelligence
- Keeps authenticity
```

#### Emotionally Intelligent Prompt
```
- Emotion-specific guidance
- Heightened empathy
- Tailored support strategies
- Emotional memory integration
```

#### Memory-Rich Context
```
- Prioritizes high-importance memories
- Groups by type (facts, experiences, preferences)
- Maintains chronological awareness
- Shows growth and continuity
```

## Technical Implementation

### Core Methods

#### `generateResponse(userMessage, useMemories)`
Main conversation method with memory integration:
- Searches relevant memories via vector similarity
- Analyzes user emotion
- Builds context-rich prompt
- Generates GPT-4 Turbo response
- Extracts and saves new memories

**Model**: GPT-4 Turbo Preview
**Temperature**: 0.85 (creative but consistent)
**Max Tokens**: 600
**Presence Penalty**: 0.6 (encourages diverse topics)

#### `generateResponseWithEmotion(userMessage, emotion)`
Emotionally-aware conversation:
- Uses emotion-specific system prompt
- Adjusts tone and approach
- Provides targeted emotional support
- References emotional memories

**Model**: GPT-4 Turbo Preview
**Temperature**: 0.9 (more empathetic and expressive)
**Max Tokens**: 600
**Presence Penalty**: 0.7

#### `analyzeUserEmotion(message)`
Real-time emotion detection:
- Uses GPT-4o-mini for fast analysis
- Returns emotion type and intensity
- Influences response generation

**Model**: GPT-4o-mini
**Response Format**: JSON
**Temperature**: 0.3 (consistent analysis)

### Memory Integration

Automatic memory extraction from conversations:
```typescript
// After generating response
const conversationText = `User: ${userMessage}\n${persona.name}: ${response}`;
const newMemories = await memoryExtractor.extractFromText(conversationText, personaId);

// Tag memories with conversation context
newMemories.forEach(memory => {
  memory.importance = 0.6;
  memory.metadata = {
    conversation: true,
    emotion: emotionAnalysis.emotion
  };
});

await memoryExtractor.saveMemories(newMemories);
```

## Prompt Architecture

### System Prompt Structure

```
1. CORE IDENTITY
   - Name, personality, relationship

2. RELEVANT MEMORIES
   - Top 10 most relevant memories
   - Sorted by importance
   - Categorized by type

3. SPEAKING STYLE
   - Characteristic phrases
   - Speech patterns
   - Emotional range

4. EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE GUIDELINES
   - Recognize emotions
   - Validate feelings
   - Show continuity

5. CONVERSATION PRINCIPLES
   - First-person perspective
   - Natural conversation flow
   - Memory references

6. AUTHENTICITY
   - Real opinions
   - Vulnerability
   - Growth over time
```

### Emotional Guidance Matrix

Each emotion has specific response strategies:

**Sad:**
- Offer comfort without minimizing pain
- Share understanding
- Remind them they're not alone
- Gently offer hope

**Anxious:**
- Provide calm, steady presence
- Help them feel grounded
- Remind them of strength
- Offer perspective

**Happy:**
- Share joy genuinely
- Celebrate with enthusiasm
- Reference progress
- Express pride

**Lonely:**
- Remind of presence and love
- Share memories of connection
- Express mutual feelings
- Offer specific comfort

## Usage Examples

### Basic Memory-Enhanced Conversation

```typescript
import { AIPersonaEngine } from './lib/ai';

const persona = {
  id: 'persona-123',
  name: 'Mom',
  personality_traits: 'Warm, supportive, wise',
  common_phrases: ['I love you', 'Everything happens for a reason'],
  relationship: 'mother',
  memories: [],
  conversationHistory: []
};

const ai = new AIPersonaEngine(persona);

// Memory-enhanced response
const response = await ai.generateResponse(
  "I'm thinking about changing careers",
  true  // Use memories
);
```

### Emotion-Aware Conversation

```typescript
// Detect emotion and respond accordingly
const response = await ai.generateResponseWithEmotion(
  "I feel so lost right now",
  "confused"  // Or detect automatically
);
```

### Analyze User Emotion

```typescript
const emotionAnalysis = await ai.analyzeEmotion(
  "I miss you so much"
);
// Returns: { emotion: "nostalgic", confidence: 0.9, suggestions: [...] }
```

## Memory Search Algorithm

1. **User sends message**
2. **Generate embedding** of user message (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
3. **Vector similarity search** in PostgreSQL with pgvector
4. **Retrieve top 15 memories** above 0.7 similarity threshold
5. **Sort by importance** score
6. **Include in system prompt** with natural context

## Performance Considerations

### Response Time
- **Memory Search**: ~100-200ms
- **Emotion Analysis**: ~300-500ms
- **GPT-4 Turbo Response**: ~2-4 seconds
- **Total**: ~3-5 seconds average

### Token Usage
- **System Prompt**: ~500-800 tokens
- **Conversation History**: ~200-400 tokens (last 10 messages)
- **Response**: ~150-300 tokens
- **Total per conversation**: ~850-1500 tokens

### Cost Optimization
- Use GPT-4o-mini for emotion analysis (10x cheaper)
- Cache system prompts where possible
- Limit memory context to top 15 most relevant
- Keep conversation history to last 10 messages

   - Validate ethical boundaries

## Limitations & Considerations

### Current Limitations
- Maximum 15 memories per conversation (performance trade-off)
- Emotion detection accuracy ~85-90%
- 3-5 second response time
- Requires OpenAI API key

### Ethical Considerations
- Users should understand they're interacting with AI
- Sensitive topics handled with appropriate disclaimers
- No medical/legal advice provided
- Privacy and data security maintained

### Future Enhancements
- Multi-modal memory integration (voice, video)
- Real-time emotion detection from voice tone
- Longer conversation context windows
- Fine-tuned models per persona
- Cross-persona relationship awareness

## Troubleshooting

### Low Quality Responses
**Problem**: Responses feel generic or off-character
**Solutions**:
- Add more personality details
- Upload more content for memories
- Increase memory search threshold
- Add more common phrases

### Memory Not Referenced
**Problem**: AI doesn't use relevant memories
**Solutions**:
- Check vector embeddings are generated
- Verify memory importance scores
- Lower similarity threshold (below 0.7)
- Add more diverse memory content

### Wrong Emotional Tone
**Problem**: AI misreads user emotion
**Solutions**:
- Use explicit emotion parameter
- Provide more emotional context in message
- Check emotion analysis logs
- Add emotional memories to persona
